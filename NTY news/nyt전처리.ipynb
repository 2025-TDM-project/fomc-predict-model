Officials said the data were evidence that the city's anemic job recovery had stalled.  [ Page 1. ]   The nation's unemployment rate eased two-tenths of a point in January, to 7.1 percent, but the rate dropped only because the number of people in the labor force fell.  [ 47. ]   Consumers borrowed heavily in December, driving up their debt at the fastest rate in nearly two years.  [ 34. ]   The Fed said it abandoned its tilt toward lower interest rates in December and adopted a neutral policy.  [ 35. ]  Companies    British Airways' chairman resigned amid other management changes taken to restore the airline's image after reports of a dirty tricks campaign against Virgin Atlantic Airways.  [ 35. ]   American Airlines may close two hubs and retire several planes in a retreat from its strategy to operate nationwide.  [ 35. ]   Analysts wonder whether Jack in the Box will be able to recover from the crisis created when two children died from infections linked to tainted food at some of its restaurants.  [ 35. ]   Barr Laboratories was ordered to recall batches of some of its medicines and stop distributing others until it studies its manufacturing process. Its stock price dropped 30 percent.  [ 37. ]   Amgen shares plummeted after earnings were released and analysts lowered their recommendations on the stock.  [ 37. ]   Microsoft was not disciplined by the F.T.C. over accusations of unfair competition in personal computer software.  [ 37. ]   Adidas formed a new U.S. subsidiary to be headed by the founder of an Oregon sports marketing company it bought.  [ 37. ]   Long Island Lighting's plan to sell some of its rights to pollute to another company -- a feature of the Clean Air Act of 1990 -- has raised fears that the law will not help improve air quality.  [ 1. ]   A $105 million jury verdict against General Motors, holding it liable for the death of a teen-ager in one of its trucks said to be prone to catch fire in accidents, has renewed calls to curb punitive damage awards.  [ 6. ] International    Interest rate cuts by Japan and Germany were welcomed by American officials, many of whom want the two nations to do more to stimulate their languishing economies.  [ 34. ] Markets    The Dow hit a second straight record high, rising 25.40 points to 3,310.03. Its gain for the week was the third-best ever.  [ 35. ]   Treasury bond prices advanced, with the yield on the 30-year bond falling to 7.15 percent.  [ 44. ]   Lumber futures took a wild ride, with the March contract up the $10 limit while subsequent months closed $10 lower.  [ 46. ]   The dollar finished stronger against the German mark but mixed against other major currencies. Gold was mostly lower.  [ 46. ]  Your Money    A home office presents pitfalls in taking tax deductions unless strict Internal Revenue Service guidelines are followed.  [ 33. ]   Many stock newsletters will now boast of good \\\"long term\\\" performance because the effects of the October 1987 crash are gone from their five-year track records.  [ 33. ]   The few extra dollars that began showing up in weekly paychecks after withholding taxes were cut last year means that refunds will be skimpier and that some will owe taxes.  [ 33. ]   Many recipients of employer-provided tuition benefits do not know the benefits are taxable. They may get a rude shock when they find out how the tuition was handled for tax purposes.  [ 34. ]   A college student cut her education costs in half by going to a community college for two years before transferring.

Morgan and Merrill Lynch also said they were active in the market. The firms hope to profit by\n","trading, retaining or restructuring the securities. Page 1.    By using relatively simple techniques to diffuse the risk\n","of the derivatives immediately, these firms can lock in a hefty profit. 38. Durable Goods Signal Slowdown, Sending\n","Stocks, Bonds Soaring  Orders for durable goods fell 0.8 percent in February to $163 billion, the first decline in four\n","months. The report provided further evidence that the manufacturing expansion was slowing and eased fears that the Fed\n","would increase interest rates next week. 36.  The report helped send the Dow up 50 points, to a record 4,138.67, and\n","30-year bonds up a full point, reducing their yield to 7.36 percent That's the lowest level in a week. The dollar rose\n","to 1.4210 marks and 88.95 yen. 37. Signs of Success Help Peso, Stocks The peso rebounded to 6.815 to the dollar and the\n","Mexican stock exchange roared back 107 points amid signs that the country's economic recovery plan was beginning to\n","work. 38. Senate Votes to Repeal Tax Break The Senate voted to repeal a tax break aimed at helping minorities buy cable\n","and broadcast companies. The vote is a setback for Viacom, which agreed last year to sell its cable operations for $2.3\n","billion to a black entrepreneur in California. 39. Group Demands Tax Cut Delay Dozens of moderate Republicans in the\n","House, joined by 23 Democrats who have consistently voted with the majority, demanded that any reductions in taxes be\n","delayed until Congress has passed spending cuts sufficient to compensate for the lost revenue as well as to balance the\n","budget. 1. Rules Proposed for Small Aircraft The Transportation Department proposed tougher operating requirements and\n","equipment standards for small commuter planes, bringing them closer in line to the standards for planes operated by the\n","major airlines. Among the requirements, commuter pilots could no longer work longer hours than pilots for the major\n","carriers and would receive the same level of training. 1. Boeing Offers Retirement Option Boeing announced retirement\n","incentives intended to reduce the number of involuntary layoffs needed to reach its goal of cutting 7,000 jobs this\n","year. The plan will result in a one-time charge of $350 million to $400 million in the company's second fiscal quarter.\n","39. Time Warner to Sell Atari Stake Time Warner plans to sell part or all of its 24.5 percent stake in Atari in a move\n","to reduce its debt. The stake is worth about $42.9 million. 41. Shareholders Say No to Rowland Roland (Tiny) Rowland\n","narrowly lost a shareholder vote to become president of Lonrho, after having been dismissed as co-chief executive. He\n","was to be named president, but the board withdrew its support. 38. Bronco II Settlement Rejected  A judge has rejected\n","Ford's settlement stemming from claims that the Bronco II is prone to rolling over. The judge said the agreement\n","provided huge fees for lawyers but \"zero\" benefits for Bronco owners. 7.  H.M.O.
